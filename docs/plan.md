# Project Plan

## Overview

This document describes the delivery plan for a small MVP project.
The work is organized into two iterations with a fixed time limit per role.
Sync time and communication overhead are included in estimates.

---

## Constraints

- Two iterations, 1.5 weeks each
- Total project limit: 220 hours
- Development roles have a limit of 40 hours per iteration
- Scope is limited to MVP
- Infrastructure, deployment, and quality assurance are included

- Data models and reference structures — 6h  
- Authentication API (sign in / sign up) — 10h  
- Basic matching logic (rule-based) — 10h  
- Syncs and communication — 4h  

### Quality Assurance (18 hours)

- Test plan and checklists — 6h  
- Smoke testing of core flow — 10h  
- Syncs — 2h  

### Project Management (12 hours)

- MVP requirements and acceptance criteria — 5h  
- Iteration planning and task setup — 3h  
- Coordination and syncs — 4h  

**Iteration total:** 110 hours

- Result view and content layout — 10h  
- API integration and error handling — 8h  
- UI fixes based on feedback — 6h  
- Syncs — 4h  

### Backend (37 hours)

- Matching logic improvements and aggregation — 14h  
- Input validation and error handling — 6h  
- CI pipeline setup — 9h  
- Staging deployment and verification — 6h  
- Syncs — 2h  

### Quality Assurance (24 hours)

- Functional testing — 10h  
- Authentication and error scenarios — 6h  
- Regression testing — 6h  
- Syncs — 2h  

### Project Management (11 hours)

- Feature acceptance — 5h

## Summary

| Role | Total hours |
|-----|------------|
| Frontend | 78 |
| Backend | 77 |
| Quality Assurance | 42 |
| Project Management | 23 |
| **Planned total** | **220** |

The plan intentionally keeps scope minimal and allows controlled adjustments
without impacting the core user flow.
